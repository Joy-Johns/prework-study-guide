# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 This Study Guide was developed for asporing Bootcampers beginning their journey in the Web Development. It is easy to forget the important concepts, so this study guide will serve as a user-friendly tool to refer to throughout the program. Foundational information includes Git/GitHub, HTMP, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage
Each section contains notes about topics ranging from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and Git. Opening the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. Topics learned from the prework were setting up projects in Git and GitHub, working with programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I would recommend starting with the Git and GitHub set up first as that sets the foundation for all programs to work together.
